## ⚠ warnings ⚠
- Use this at your own risk. This *can* get your account permanantly locked by mojang. It is very rare and won't happen if you know what you're doing.
- If your accounts have security questions you cannot use more than 3 per IP address. This makes getting names very difficult so please avoid using accounts with security questions.
- **DO NOT USE A CUSTOM DELAY OF BELOW 40 IN MOST CASES. Refer to the [FAQ page](https://github.com/Kqzz/MCsniperPY/wiki/FAQ) on the wiki for info on custom delay.**
- Please don't come into the discord and ask people for delays. You'll have to learn them for yourself. 

## More info
